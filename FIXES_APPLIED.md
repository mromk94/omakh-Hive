# ✅ Critical Fixes Applied

## 1. ✅ FloatingMenu No Longer Redirects
- Removed isConnected logic
- Menu stays in chat
- All actions trigger chat messages, not page navigation

## 2. ✅ Demo Mode Added
- DashboardCard has `demoMode` prop
- SwapCard has `demoMode` prop  
- Both show demo data without wallet connection
- Passed `demoMode={true}` in chat rendering

## 3. ✅ Login Flow Fixed  
- "Yes, I have account" → Offers wallet OR email login
- Added wallet connect option in login
- Added email login as separate flow

## 4. ✅ Onboarding Flow Fixed
- "No, I'm new" → Asks "Do you have a wallet?"
- YES → WalletConnectCard
- NO → Teacher Bee mode
- Email signup option added

## 5. ✅ Menu Actions Fixed
- `dashboard` → Shows DashboardCard in chat
- `buy_omk` → Shows SwapCard in chat
- All menu clicks stay IN THE CHAT

## 6. ✅ Complete Flow Working
```
