i want you to go through everything in this prompt, make sure to fully analyze completely, it's a collective compilation of ideas/plans on an AI Hive mind, even though it will be it's own entity, can be plugged into the omk token swapping/minting/tokenization platform(you will find more details about all of these as you go through the writeup)

after performing your detailed analysis, i want you to create a proper programming roadmap like this:
first classify the different programming/development tasks into 10 departments/classes/stages- these stages are basically each group of tasks we need to do to fully and completely achieve everything in each stage, document all of of this inside LOGS.MD under the heading PRIME TASKS,

then create a detailed list of todo under each prime task 1-10, after you are done with this, we will go thought these todo's together and fine tune it till we have all aspects mapped out. everything should be documented in logs.md, that would serve as our primary project logging file. this is very important

# OMK Hive AI ‚Äî Whitepaper & Development Framework (Full)

> **Merged:** Your OMK Day0‚ÜíDay30 launch plan + Hive AI architecture + full engineering TODOs, drip schedule, tokenomics, scenarios, and appendices.

---

## Executive summary (top-line)

Private prelaunch allocation: **100,000,000 OMK** (step pricing every 10M: $0.100 ‚Üí $0.145).

Airdrop: **10,000,000 OMK** reserved for growth tasks.

Private investor vesting: fully vested (not withdrawable) over **6 months** (recommended linear monthly unlock after TGE).

Likely funds raised (three scenarios):
- **Conservative** ‚Äî ~60M sold ‚Üí **$6.75M** raised.
- **Base** ‚Äî ~90M sold ‚Üí **$10.8M** raised.
- **Aggressive** ‚Äî 100M sold ‚Üí **$12.25M** raised.

Recommended immediate liquidity allocation: **25‚Äì35%** of proceeds to seed LPs (split ~70% ETH / 30% SOL).

Base pool sizing (Day0 / Day1): ETH pool ~3M OMK : 3M USDT, Solana pool ~1M : 1M.

Day 30 objective: grow cross-chain LP depth toward **$15M USDT : 15M OMK** (TVL ‚âà $30M) by combining proceeds, partner liquidity, listing incentives, and staged bridge/mint.

Risk control: private vesting (6m), anti-whale caps for Day1, drip contract seeding, relayer & multisig bridge, and a rebalancer bot / treasury reserve.

---

## Assumptions (explicit)
1. Step pricing every 10M: 0.100, 0.105, 0.110, 0.115, 0.120, 0.125, 0.130, 0.135, 0.140, 0.145.
2. Private token demand filled sequentially tier ‚Üí tier.
3. Private investors‚Äô tokens locked/vested for 6 months.
4. Airdrop 10M OMK used for KYC/referral tasks & bootstrap wallet counts.
5. Price engine is off-chain master for both ETH & SOL purchases.
6. LP math uses constant-product AMM model (Uniswap/Raydium style).
7. Public launch price parity objective: **1 OMK = $1 USDT** at TGE (initial pool parity).

---

## Appendix A ‚Äî exact private sale math (step tiers)

Tiers (10M each):
- 0‚Äì10M @ $0.100 = $1,000,000
- 10‚Äì20M @ $0.105 = $1,050,000
- 20‚Äì30M @ $0.110 = $1,100,000
- 30‚Äì40M @ $0.115 = $1,150,000
- 40‚Äì50M @ $0.120 = $1,200,000
- 50‚Äì60M @ $0.125 = $1,250,000
- 60‚Äì70M @ $0.130 = $1,300,000
- 70‚Äì80M @ $0.135 = $1,350,000
- 80‚Äì90M @ $0.140 = $1,400,000
- 90‚Äì100M @ $0.145 = $1,450,000

Full 100M sold ‚Üí total = **$12,250,000**; weighted avg price $0.1225 / OMK.

90M sold ‚Üí total = **$10,800,000**; avg $0.12.

80M sold ‚Üí total = **$9,400,000**; avg $0.1175.

60M sold ‚Üí total = **$6,750,000**; avg $0.1125.

---

## Three realistic pre-launch scenarios (numbers + explanation)

### Scenario 1 ‚Äî Conservative (low marketing)
- Private sold: ~60M ‚Üí $6.75M raised.
- LP allocation: 25% ‚Üí $1.6875M USDT total LP (ETH ‚âà $1.18M + SOL ‚âà $0.51M). Seed pools 1.18M OMK:1.18M USDT (ETH) and 0.51M:0.51M (SOL).
- Day1: small retail demand ‚Äî 100k OMK buys move ETH pool spot from $1 ‚Üí ~$1.19 (‚âà19% jump).
- Day30: TVL ‚âà $3M‚Äì$6M, OMK $1‚Äì$3.

### Scenario 2 ‚Äî Base / roadmap
- Private sold: ~90M ‚Üí $10.8M raised.
- LP allocation: 25% ‚Üí $2.7M USDT for LP (ETH ‚âà $1.89M : 1.89M OMK, SOL ‚âà $0.81M : 0.81M OMK).
- Day1 behavior with 3M-ish ETH pool: 500k OMK buys move spot $1 ‚Üí ~$1.4 (avg paid ‚âà $1.20).
- Day30: TVL $10M‚Äì$20M; OMK trading $3‚Äì$8 if demand sustains.

### Scenario 3 ‚Äî Aggressive / viral
- Private sold: 100M ‚Üí $12.25M raised.
- LP allocation: 30‚Äì35% to LP ‚Üí $3.675M ‚Äì $4.2875M (ETH pool $2.57M ‚Äì $3.00M, SOL $1.10M ‚Äì $1.29M).
- Day1: big opens; deeper pools avoid immediate 10√ó spikes. A 1M buy on a 2.57M pool avg paid ~$1.63, spot ~2.68.
- Day30: TVL $20‚Äì$40M possible; OMK $6‚Äì$10+ with continued adoption.

---

## Day0 ‚Üí Day30 Operational Plan (merged & detailed)

### Pre-Launch (T-7 ‚Üí Day 0)
- Marketing teasers; 10M OMK airdrop for microtasks; influencer seeding.
- Prepare 200‚Äì300k paid push timed to Day0‚ÄìDay3.
- Deploy ERC-20 OMK, Solana SPL wrapper (mint disabled until relayer active).
- Deploy locking multisig for founders (250M locked).

### Liquidity plan (Day0 pre-seed)
- Seed ETH pool with 1‚Äì3M OMK : 1‚Äì3M USDT (prefer 3M:3M for base if funds allow).
- Seed SOL pool 0.5‚Äì1M : 0.5‚Äì1M.
- Deploy a DripController contract holding 10M OMK for automated top-ups.

### KYC & anti-bot
- KYC large buyers.
- Rate limits & cap $25k per buyer during Day1.
- Public buy cap $25k early to limit dumping; negotiated larger allocations for VCs with vesting.

### TGE / Day 1
- Open official pools at parity 1 OMK = $1 USDT.
- Activate price engine (off-chain master) to accept ETH & SOL sales.
- Drip contract configured for scheduled top-ups.
- Anti-whale enforcement and transparency dashboard.

### Days 1‚Äì7
- Launch 200‚Äì300k marketing burst.
- Top up ETH pool to 3M:3M if not done.
- Property funnel activation; conversions for property slots.

### Days 8‚Äì14
- Stabilize and convert: installment UX, yield simulator, next liquidity tranche.

### Days 15‚Äì30
- First rent distribution (proof-of-yield), DAO preview, TVL push to Day30 targets.

---

## Smart-contract Drip Schedule (practical, exact numbers)

**Goal:** avoid big dumps and steadily increase LP depth.

**dripReserve:** 10,000,000 OMK reserved for automated LP top-ups.(proposal/suggestion can be raised by the queen of hive to admin for increase of this, admin approval should be prepared alongside this request)

**Concrete schedule: this should be left to omk hive ai queen to provide**
1. **Day0 (TGE)** ‚Äî Seed ETH pool 1.0‚Äì3.0M OMK : 1.0‚Äì3.0M USDT; SOL pool 0.5‚Äì1.0M : 0.5‚Äì1.0M.
2. **Daily drip (Day1 ‚Üí Day22)** ‚Äî Auto top-up **500,000 OMK** to LP per day until 10M exhausted (10M / 0.5M ‚âà 20 days). Split 70/30 to ETH/SOL. Paired with USDT from treasury(Adjustable by admin approved instruction from omk hive ai queen)
3. **Weekly larger top-ups** ‚Äî 1‚Äì2M OMK per week if demand justifies.
4. **Public 400M release schedule** ‚Äî this should be provided by the hive queen, dynamically adjusted to market conditions and demand momentum and price goal.
5. **Private investor unlocks** ‚Äî 12-month cliff then linear release over next 12 months (recommended staggered releases).
6. **Emergency reserve** ‚Äî Keep 5‚Äì10% of raised funds as USDT stabilization reserve.

**Auto-cap rule:** daily automated top-up ‚â§ 30% of daily drip budget and ‚â§ X% of treasury buffer; larger moves require multisig.

---

## Cross-chain mechanics & mitigating liquidity split
- ETH is master chain; bridge OMK ‚Üí sOMK via lock/mint relayer.
- Keep price engine centralized initially for parity.
- Seed ETH pool larger than SOL pool; auto-rebalancer to manage delta.
- Multisig relayer initially; move toward decentralized validator set as maturity grows.

---

## Risks & Mitigations (actionable) OMK HIVE HOPEFULLY SOLVES THIS:
- Wild price spikes: deeper ETH pool (3‚Äì5M), larger LP allocation, drip schedule.
- Arbitrage across chains: single price engine + rebalancer bot.
- Wash trading/bot front-running: KYC for large buyers, CAPTCHAs, per-order timelocks.
- Bridge failure: multisig + audits + contingency funds.
- Community distrust: on-chain proof of liquidity, audits, visible vesting, and rent distribution.

---

## Immediate tactical checklist (prioritized)
1. Publish tokenomics table on site (transparent allocations & locks).
2. Audit the lock/escrow + drip contracts and Solana program.
3. Decide LP allocation % of proceeds.
4. Set drip rules under multisig control (500k/day default).
5. Acquire USDT liquidity for pairings; prepare to seed ETH pool at ‚â•3M:3M.
6. Announce KYC & per-wallet caps for Day1.
7. Run marketing push (airdrop + 48‚Äì72 hour surge).

---

## Hive AI: Queen + Bees (full merged architecture)
**Goal:** Build a modular AI collective (company-like) where the Queen AI coordinates specialized models (bees). The Queen proposes and authors on-chain proposals (hashes) but **cannot move large funds alone(threashhold set by admin) ‚Äî multisig human signoff and timelocks required for critical actions.

### Bees & Responsibilities (recap)
- **Maths Bee** ‚Äî AMM math, slippage & scenario simulation functions.
- **Logic Bee** ‚Äî policy enforcement and contract logic checks.
- **Purchase Bee** ‚Äî off-chain sale engine for ETH & SOL purchases.
- **Price Control Dept / Liquidity Sentinel** ‚Äî monitors pools, suggests top-ups, triggers rebalances.
- **Fractionalized Assets Dept** ‚Äî slot manager, mortgage/instalment handlers, yield accounting.
- **Tokenization Dept** ‚Äî mints fractional NFTs, metadata management.
- **Treasury Bee** ‚Äî forecasting & buyback signals.
- **Pattern Recognition Bee** ‚Äî ML for momentum, wash trade detection, arbitrage detection.
- **Stake Bot** ‚Äî manages staking reward rates & vaults.
- **Visualization Bee** ‚Äî dashboards, simulation UIs, investor reports.
- **Agent Factory Bee** ‚Äî creates new bees (subject to governance & sandboxing).

**Communication:** Message bus (Kafka/Redis), event store, TSDB, model registry; Queen issues tasks to bees and aggregates outputs into proposals.

**Safety:** Queen suggests, multisig executes; timelocks and emergency kill switches in contracts.

---

## Smart-contract Architecture & Interfaces (technical)
Contracts (ETH + SOL wrapper):
- **OMK ERC20** & **OMK SPL** (mint/burn by relayer only)
- **DripController** ‚Äî holds dripReserve; `topUpLP(poolId, usdtAmount, omkAmount)` callable by approved relayer after signature/timelock.
- **VestingManager** ‚Äî private investor schedules.
- **FractionalAssetManager** ‚Äî mints fractional NFTs/receipts.
- **PolicyRegistry** ‚Äî stores policy hashes to ensure on-chain/off-chain alignment.
- **ProposalRegistry** ‚Äî stores Queen proposals and their status.
- **GovernanceDAO** ‚Äî supports token-based voting (later stage).

Security patterns: timelocks, multisig, pausability, and minimal trusted upgradeability.

---

## Drip & Liquidity Orchestrator (Algorithm summary)
Core loop:
1. Liquidity Sentinel ingests: pool balances, trade flow, oracle prices.
2. Compute risk score; estimate required top-up via Maths Bee.
3. Queen composes a proposal with simulations and rationale.
4. If within auto-cap -> DripController executes after Queen sign; else -> multisig proposal with time lock.
5. Log and monitor.

Pseudocode sample included in appendix (simulate_swap etc.).

---

## Fractionalized Assets Dept (property / slot manager)
- Manage property objects and slot definitions.
- Enforce eligibility for slot purchases (min OMK locked, KYC).
- Manage installment plans and mint receipts (ERC-721/1155).
- Automate rent distributions to token holders with verifiable off-chain proofs.

---

## AI Models & Data Flows
- Rule-based models for deterministic tasks.
- Supervised ML for pattern recognition and anomaly detection.
- Time-series forecasting for treasury & liquidity planning.
- RL-lite experiments for policy optimization in simulation.
- Shadow mode verification for 7‚Äì14 days before live.

---

## Dashboard & Simulator
- Investor dashboard: pools, vesting, TVL, price.
- Admin view: model outputs, pending proposals, treasury.
- Simulation playground: Python/Streamlit or Node microservice exposing `/api/simulate` to test AMM responses.

---

## Website / Software Framework & Flowcharts
- Frontend: React + TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind.
- Backend: Node.js (NestJS/Express) + Python ML endpoints (FastAPI).
- DB: Postgres + Redis + event store.
- Smart-contracts: Hardhat (Solidity), Anchor (Solana).
- DevOps: Terraform, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions.

## Appendix: Sample Maths Bee function (simulate_swap)
```
function simulate_swap(amount_in, reserve_in, reserve_out) {
  const amount_in_with_fee = amount_in * 0.997; // 0.3% fee
  const numerator = amount_in_with_fee * reserve_out;
  const denominator = reserve_in + amount_in_with_fee;
  const amount_out = numerator / denominator;
  const new_reserve_in = reserve_in + amount_in;
  const new_reserve_out = reserve_out - amount_out;
  const spot_price_after = new_reserve_in / new_reserve_out;
  const avg_price_paid = amount_in / amount_out;
  return { amount_out, spot_price_after, avg_price_paid };
}
```
