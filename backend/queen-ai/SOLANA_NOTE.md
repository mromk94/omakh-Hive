# Solana Integration - Temporarily Disabled

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** Solana packages disabled for Cloud Run deployment

---

## Issue

The `solders` package (required for Solana integration) needs Rust compiler to build from source. This significantly increases Cloud Run build time and complexity.

## Temporary Solution

**Disabled Solana packages in `requirements-prod.txt`:**
```python
# Solana packages temporarily disabled (require Rust compiler)
# solana==0.30.2
# solders==0.18.1
```

**Made Solana imports optional in `app/blockchain/solana_client.py`:**
```python
try:
    from solders.keypair import Keypair
    # ... other imports
    SOLANA_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    SOLANA_AVAILABLE = False
    # Mock classes
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Backend will deploy successfully
- ✅ Ethereum functionality works (web3.py)
- ✅ All bees operational (except Solana-specific features)
- ⚠️ Solana bridge features disabled temporarily
- ⚠️ Cannot interact with Solana blockchain yet

---

## How to Re-Enable Solana (Later)

### Option 1: Use Pre-Built Wheels (Recommended)

```bash
# Use manylinux wheels that don't require compilation
pip install solana==0.30.2
pip install solders==0.18.1 --only-binary=:all:
```

### Option 2: Build Custom Docker Image with Rust

```dockerfile
# Install Rust in builder stage
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"

# Then install solders
RUN pip install solders==0.18.1
```

### Option 3: Use Cloud Build with Longer Timeout

```bash
gcloud run deploy omk-queen-ai \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --timeout 900 \  # 15 minutes for Rust compilation
  --memory 4Gi \
  --cpu 4
```

## When to Re-Enable

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Re-enable when:**
1. ✅ Backend is stable on Cloud Run
2. ✅ Ethereum bridge is tested
3. ✅ Core functionality verified
4. ⏳ Ready to implement Solana ↔ Ethereum bridge
5. ⏳ Need Solana wallet integration

**Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 weeks after mainnet Ethereum launch

---

## Current Workaround

The `SolanaClient` class checks `SOLANA_AVAILABLE` flag:
- If `False`: Logs warning and skips Solana operations
- All other functionality works normally
- Bridge operations will show "Solana not available" message

**No impact on:**
- Queen AI orchestration
- Ethereum smart contracts
- Token operations on Ethereum
- Dashboard/frontend
- All bees (except Solana-specific features)

---

## Testing Without Solana

You can still test:
- ✅ Backend API endpoints
- ✅ Queen AI orchestration  
- ✅ All 12 bees (with Ethereum focus)
- ✅ Dashboard integration
- ✅ Wallet connection
- ✅ Token swaps (Ethereum DEXs)

**Bridge testing:** Will need Solana re-enabled

---

**Status:** Temporary workaround for deployment  
**Impact:** Low (Solana features can be added later)  
**Action:** Re-enable after Ethereum launch stabilizes
