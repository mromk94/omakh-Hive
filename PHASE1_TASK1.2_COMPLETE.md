# ✅ PHASE 1 - TASK 1.2: Hide Incomplete Features - COMPLETED

**Date**: October 13, 2025, 9:20 PM  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Conversational Flow Maintained

---

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

Hide features without backend support while maintaining the **conversational, chat-based interface** vision. Show graceful "Coming Soon" messages that keep users engaged with working features.

---

## ✅ **CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Property Investments - HIDDEN** 🏗️

**What was broken:**
- `PropertyCard` displayed mock properties
- No backend API for real estate data (FPRIME-2 not implemented)
- User expectations set incorrectly

**What we did:**
- ✅ Replaced `show_properties` action with graceful "Coming Soon" message
- ✅ Changed property browser UI to show construction status
- ✅ Redirected users to working features: OTC purchase, ROI calculator
- ✅ Set expectations: "Available shortly after TGE"

**User Experience:**
```
User: "Show me properties"
Queen AI: "🏠 Property Investment Coming Soon!

We're preparing our luxury real estate portfolio for you! 
Properties will be available shortly after TGE.

In the meantime, you can:
[💎 Get OMK Tokens (Pre-sale)]
[📚 Learn about investing]
[🔗 Connect your wallet]"
```

---

### **2. Portfolio Dashboard - REAL DATA ONLY** 📊

**What was broken:**
- Dashboard showed mock data even without wallet connection
- Misleading user expectations

**What we did:**
- ✅ Changed `demoMode={false}` (was `true`)
- ✅ Dashboard now requires wallet connection
- ✅ Shows "Connect wallet to view portfolio" when not connected
- ✅ Only shows real holdings when connected (ETH balance, etc.)

**User Experience:**
```
Dashboard shows:
- If NOT connected: "🔐 Connect your wallet to view your portfolio"
- If CONNECTED: Real ETH balance + real OMK balance (when available)
```

---

### **3. Post-Action Redirects - UPDATED** 🔄

**Changed redirect flows to avoid broken features:**

| Previous (Broken) | New (Working) |
|-------------------|---------------|
| After login → "Browse properties" | After login → "Connect Wallet" / "Get OMK" |
| After onboarding → "Browse Properties" | After onboarding → "Get OMK" / "Calculate Returns" |
| After wallet connect → "Browse Properties" | After wallet connect → "Buy OMK" / "Calculate Returns" |
| After OTC submit → "View Dashboard" | After OTC submit → "Buy more OMK" / "Calculate Returns" |
| After swap → "Browse Properties" | After swap → "Calculate Returns" / "Buy more" |

---

### **4. Queen AI Recommendations - FILTERED** 🤖

**Added smart filtering:**
```typescript
// Filter out unavailable actions from Queen's recommendations
const availableActions = actionButtons.filter((btn: any) => 
  !['show_properties', 'show_staking', 'show_governance'].includes(btn.action)
);
```

**Impact:**
- Queen AI won't suggest broken features
- Only recommends working flows: wallet connect, OTC purchase, education
- Maintains trust and credibility
