### **6. Ledger Integration (Automatic)** ✅

**Question:** Does Queen auto-log buyer addresses to ledger for TGE?

**Answer:** YES! Here's how:

**Backend (`/api/v1/frontend/otc-request`):**
```python
# Creates OTC request with wallet address
otc_request = db.create_otc_request({
    'wallet': data['wallet'],  # ← STORED IN LEDGER
    'allocation': data['allocation'],
    'status': 'payment_received'
})

# Logged to analytics
db.log_transaction({
    'type': 'otc_request_submitted',
    'wallet': data['wallet'],  # ← TRACKED FOR TGE
    'amount_usd': amount_usd
})
```

**At TGE:**
1. Backend queries all approved OTC requests
2. Gets wallet addresses from ledger
3. Executes smart contract batch transfer
4. Tokens sent automatically to all presale wallets

**No manual intervention needed!**
