# ✅ COMPILE ISSUE FIXED!

**Time:** October 13, 2025, 11:35 AM  
**Status:** 🟢 COMPILATION NOW UPDATES STATUS CORRECTLY

---

## 🐛 **THE BUG**

**Problem:**
- Clicking "Compile All" seemed to work
- Showed "Compiling..." spinner
- Backend compiled successfully
- But contracts still showed "Not compiled"
- Deploy buttons never appeared

**Root Cause:**
Backend was looking for artifacts in **wrong folder**:
```
❌ Looking in: artifacts/contracts/core/PrivateSale.sol/
✅ Actually in:  artifacts/src/core/PrivateSale.sol/
```

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

**Changed:**
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
artifacts_path = CONTRACTS_PATH / "artifacts" / "contracts" / ...

# AFTER (Correct)
artifacts_path = CONTRACTS_PATH / "artifacts" / "src" / ...
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/queen-ai/app/api/v1/contracts.py` (line 84)
