---

### 2. **Teacher Bee Integration**

**Conversational Flow:**

```
User: "No, what's a wallet?"
  ↓
Queen: "Let me explain what a crypto wallet is!"
[Shows WalletEducationCard]
  ↓
User clicks: "Get Help" or "Contact Teacher Bee"
  ↓
Teacher Bee: "Hi! I'm Teacher Bee, your Web3 learning assistant!"
Options:
- 👛 Set up my first wallet
- 🔐 Wallet security tips
- 💰 How to buy OMK tokens
- 🏠 How real estate tokenization works
```

**Step-by-Step Wallet Setup Guide:**
When user selects "Set up my first wallet", Teacher Bee provides:
1. Install MetaMask instructions
2. Create wallet steps
3. Recovery phrase importance
4. Confirmation steps
5. Next actions (connect wallet, browse properties)

---

### 3. **Conversion Tracking System**

**File:** `/omk-frontend/app/api/analytics/conversion/route.ts`

**Tracked Events:**

| Event | Description | Category |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `wallet_education_started` | User clicked "What's a wallet?" | Learning |
| `wallet_help_requested` | User asked for Teacher Bee help | Support |
| `get_wallet_clicked` | User clicked "Get MetaMask" | Acquisition |
| `has_wallet` | User said they have a wallet | Existing User |
| `wallet_connected` | Wallet successfully connected | **High Value** |
| `first_investment` | User made first investment | **High Value** |
| `otc_purchase_requested` | User requested OTC purchase | **High Value** |

**High-Value Events:**
- Trigger real-time admin notifications
- Logged separately for priority followup
- Potential for automated incentives

**Crypto Convert Tracking:**
- Identifies users new to crypto
- Tracks educational journey
- Measures platform's role in Web3 adoption
- **This data proves we're growing the crypto ecosystem!**

---

### 4. **MetaMask Connection Fix**

**File:** `/omk-frontend/lib/web3/config.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before (broken)
connectors: [injected()]

// After (working)
connectors: [
  injected({ shimDisconnect: true }),
  metaMask(),
]
ssr: true // Enable SSR support
```

**Fixes:**
- ✅ MetaMask detection works properly
- ✅ SSR compatibility (no hydration errors)
- ✅ Disconnect/reconnect handled correctly
- ✅ Multiple wallet support (MetaMask, injected wallets)
