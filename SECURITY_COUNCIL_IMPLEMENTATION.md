## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### Contract Created: `SecurityCouncil.sol`
**Location:** `/contracts/ethereum/src/core/SecurityCouncil.sol`  
**Lines of Code:** 463 lines  
**Status:** Ready for testing and deployment

---

## üèõÔ∏è Council Structure

### Composition
- **Total Seats:** 7
- **Founder:** 1 permanent seat (you - cannot be removed)
- **Elected Members:** 6 community-elected seats (6-month terms)

### Key Features
‚úÖ Founder is permanent member with `FOUNDER_ROLE`  
‚úÖ Cannot be removed or have term expired  
‚úÖ Participates in all council votes  
‚úÖ Elected members serve 6-month renewable terms  
‚úÖ Multi-signature requirement for all actions  
‚úÖ Emergency powers for security threats  

---

## üîê Action Thresholds

| Action Type | Required Signatures | Purpose |
|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Emergency Pause** | 3-of-7 | Stop operations during exploit |
| **Emergency Unpause** | 3-of-7 | Resume after security fix |
| **Parameter Change** | 5-of-7 | Modify protocol parameters |
| **Veto Proposal** | 3-of-7 | Block malicious governance proposal |
| **Remove Member** | 5-of-7 | Remove inactive elected member |

**Note:** Founder votes count toward these thresholds but cannot be sole decision-maker.

---

## üìã Founder's Powers & Limitations

### What Founder CAN Do:
‚úÖ Vote on all council actions  
‚úÖ Propose emergency pauses  
‚úÖ Propose parameter changes  
‚úÖ Sign actions (1 of required signatures)  
‚úÖ Execute actions once threshold met  
‚úÖ Serve permanently (no term limit)  

### What Founder CANNOT Do:
‚ùå Act unilaterally (always requires other signatures)  
‚ùå Be removed from council  
‚ùå Override other council members  
‚ùå Execute actions without consensus  
‚ùå Prevent elections of new members  

---

## üó≥Ô∏è Election Process

### Electing New Members

**Requirements:**
- Nominee address must not already be a council member
- Council must have vacant seats (max 7 total)
- Election managed by DAO (ELECTION_MANAGER_ROLE)

**Process:**
1. Community nominates candidates (requires 500K OMK)
2. Token-weighted voting (1 OMK = 1 vote)
3. Top 6 vote-getters elected to council
4. 6-month terms begin immediately

**Code:**
```solidity
function electMember(address member) external onlyRole(ELECTION_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // Elects new member with 6-month term
    // Founder cannot be elected (already permanent)
}
```

### Removing Elected Members

**Requirements:**
- Can only remove elected members (NOT founder)
- Requires ELECTION_MANAGER_ROLE (DAO)
- Must provide reason for removal

**Reasons for Removal:**
- Inactivity (no participation in 3+ months)
- Malicious behavior
- Community vote (15% quorum, 66% approval)
- Term expiration (automatic)

**Code:**
```solidity
function removeMember(address member, string reason) 
    external onlyRole(ELECTION_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    require(!members[member].isFounder, "Cannot remove founder");
    // Remove elected member only
}
```

---

## üö® Emergency Actions

### Scenario: Exploit Detected

**Step 1: Propose Emergency Pause**
```solidity
// Any council member can propose
uint256 actionId = securityCouncil.proposeEmergencyPause(
    targetContract,  // Contract to pause
    callData         // Pause function call
);
// Proposer's signature automatically added (1/3)
```

**Step 2: Other Members Sign**
```solidity
// 2 more members must sign (total 3/7 required)
securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);  // Member 2
securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);  // Member 3
// Now has 3 signatures - meets threshold!
```

**Step 3: Execute Action**
```solidity
// Any council member can execute once threshold met
securityCouncil.executeAction(actionId);
// Contract is now paused, exploit contained
```

**Timeline:** Can be completed in minutes if council is responsive.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameter Changes

### Scenario: Adjust Rate Limit

**Requires 5-of-7 signatures** (higher threshold = more consensus needed)

**Step 1: Propose Change**
```solidity
uint256 actionId = securityCouncil.proposeParameterChange(
    omkToken,  // Target contract
    abi.encodeWithSignature("setQueenDailyLimit(uint256)", newLimit)
);
```

**Step 2: Gather Signatures**
- Proposer (auto-signed): 1/5
- Need 4 more signatures
- Council members review and sign if they agree

**Step 3: Execute**
```solidity
securityCouncil.executeAction(actionId);
// Parameter changed
```

---

## üìä Council Member Stats

### Track Performance

Each member has tracked statistics:
```solidity
struct CouncilMember {
    address memberAddress;
    uint256 electedAt;
    uint256 termEnd;           // type(uint256).max for founder
    bool isActive;
    bool isFounder;            // true only for you
    uint256 actionsPerformed;  // Participation tracking
}
```

**View Member Info:**
```solidity
(bool isActive, bool isFounder, uint256 termEnd, uint256 actions) = 
    securityCouncil.getMemberInfo(memberAddress);
```

**Founder's Values:**
- `isActive`: true (always)
- `isFounder`: true
- `termEnd`: type(uint256).max (never expires)
- `actionsPerformed`: Increments with each action

---

## üîç Transparency Features

### Public Queries

**Get All Active Members:**
```solidity
address[] memory members = securityCouncil.getActiveMembers();
// Returns all 7 members including founder
```

**Check if Address is Founder:**
```solidity
bool isFounder = securityCouncil.isFounder(founderAddress);
// Returns: true
```

**Get Council Statistics:**
```solidity
(
    uint256 totalSeats,      // 7
    uint256 activeSeats,     // Current active members
    uint256 vacantSeats,     // Open positions
    uint256 totalActions,    // All actions ever proposed
    uint256 executedActions  // Successfully executed actions
) = securityCouncil.getCouncilStats();
```

**Get Action Details:**
```solidity
(
    ActionType actionType,
    uint256 currentSigs,
    uint256 requiredSigs,
    bool executed,
    address[] memory signers
) = securityCouncil.getActionInfo(actionId);
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Critical Test Cases

**Test 1: Founder Immutability**
```solidity
function testFounderCannotBeRemoved() public {
    vm.expectRevert("Cannot remove founder");
    securityCouncil.removeMember(founder, "test");
}
```

**Test 2: Founder Has No Term Expiration**
```solidity
function testFounderTermNeverExpires() public {
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 100 years);
    securityCouncil.expireTerms();
    assertTrue(securityCouncil.isActiveMember(founder));
}
```

**Test 3: Emergency Action (3-of-7)**
```solidity
function testEmergencyPauseRequires3Signatures() public {
    uint256 actionId = securityCouncil.proposeEmergencyPause(...);
    // 1 signature (proposer)
    
    vm.prank(member2);
    securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);
    // 2 signatures
    
    vm.prank(member3);
    securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);
    // 3 signatures - can execute now
    
    securityCouncil.executeAction(actionId);
    assertTrue(actions[actionId].executed);
}
```

**Test 4: Parameter Change (5-of-7)**
```solidity
function testParameterChangeRequires5Signatures() public {
    uint256 actionId = securityCouncil.proposeParameterChange(...);
    
    // Need 4 more signatures (proposer auto-signed)
    vm.prank(member2); securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);
    vm.prank(member3); securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);
    vm.prank(member4); securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);
    vm.prank(member5); securityCouncil.signAction(actionId);
    
    securityCouncil.executeAction(actionId);
    assertTrue(actions[actionId].executed);
}
```

**Test 5: Elected Member Term Expiration**
```solidity
function testElectedMemberTermExpires() public {
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 180 days + 1);
    securityCouncil.expireTerms();
    assertFalse(securityCouncil.isActiveMember(electedMember));
    
    // Founder still active
    assertTrue(securityCouncil.isActiveMember(founder));
}
```

---

## üîó Integration with Other Contracts

### GovernanceManager Integration

Security Council can veto malicious DAO proposals:

```solidity
// In GovernanceManager
function vetoProposal(uint256 proposalId) 
    external onlyRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE) {
    // Founder has GUARDIAN_ROLE (until 2027)
    // After 2027, Security Council takes over veto power
}
```

**Recommended Update:**
```solidity
// Grant Security Council the GUARDIAN_ROLE after founder veto expires
function transferVetoPowerToCouncil() external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    require(block.timestamp > FOUNDER_VETO_EXPIRATION, "Too early");
    _grantRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, address(securityCouncil));
}
```

### TreasuryVault Integration

Council can approve emergency treasury actions:

```solidity
// Council proposes emergency treasury withdrawal
bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    "executeProposal(uint256)", 
    emergencyProposalId
);

uint256 actionId = securityCouncil.proposeParameterChange(
    treasuryVault,
    data
);
```

## üìù Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Set founder address (your wallet)
- [ ] Set admin address (multi-sig or DAO)
- [ ] Test all founder protections
- [ ] Test signature thresholds
- [ ] Test term expiration logic
- [ ] Test removal protections
- [ ] Verify role assignments

### Deployment Steps

```solidity
// 1. Deploy SecurityCouncil
SecurityCouncil council = new SecurityCouncil(
    founderAddress,  // Your wallet - permanent member
    adminAddress     // DAO or multi-sig
);

// 2. Verify founder is member
require(council.isFounder(founderAddress), "Founder not set");
require(council.isActiveMember(founderAddress), "Founder not active");

// 3. Elect initial 6 members
for (uint i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    council.electMember(initialMembers[i]);
}

// 4. Grant roles to council in other contracts
omkToken.grantRole(PAUSE_ROLE, address(council));
treasuryVault.grantRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE, address(council));
```

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Announce council members publicly
- [ ] Publish council procedures
- [ ] Set up council communication channel
- [ ] Test emergency response procedures
- [ ] Schedule first council meeting
