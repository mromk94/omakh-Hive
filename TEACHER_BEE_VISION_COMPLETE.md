### 3. ✅ Gemini Vision Integration

**Backend:** Queen AI now has vision capabilities!

**Flow:**
```
User uploads screenshot
  ↓
Frontend → /api/teacher-bee/analyze-screenshot
  ↓
Converts to base64
  ↓
Queen AI Backend → /api/v1/teacher-bee/analyze-image
  ↓
Gemini Vision API (gemini-2.0-flash)
  ↓
AI analyzes screenshot:
  - Identifies which MetaMask step
  - Sees specific UI elements
  - Detects error messages
  - Spots security issues
  ↓
Contextual response sent back
  ↓
User sees helpful guidance
```

**Gemini Provider Enhancement:**
```python
async def generate_with_vision(
    self,
    prompt: str,
    image_base64: str,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_tokens: int = 1000
) -> str:
    # Decode image
    image_data = base64.b64decode(image_base64)
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_data))
    
    # Generate with vision
    response = self.model.generate_content(
        [prompt, image],  # ← Image + prompt together
        generation_config=...
    )
    
    return response.text
```

---

### 4. ✅ Teacher Bee Context Awareness

**System Messages by Context:**

**MetaMask Setup Context:**
```python
"""You are Teacher Bee 🐝, helping users set up MetaMask.

If analyzing a screenshot, identify:
- Which step they're on (1-5)
- Specific UI elements to click
- Any error messages
- Security warnings if recovery phrase visible
- Congratulate progress

Guidelines:
- Be encouraging and patient
- Use simple language
- Give step-by-step instructions
- Use emojis (🦊 🔒 ✅ ⚠️)
- Emphasize security for recovery phrases
"""
```

**Wallet Security Context:**
```python
"""Focus on security best practices:
- Recovery phrase NEVER shared
- No screenshots, no cloud storage
- Write on paper only
- Beware of fake support
"""
```

---

### 5. ✅ Intelligent Fallback Responses

**If Gemini unavailable**, Teacher Bee provides context-aware text responses:

```python
if "step 1" in question or "install" in question:
    response = """🦊 Installing MetaMask:
    1. Go to metamask.io/download
    2. Click button for your browser
    3. Click 'Add to Chrome'
    4. Look for 🦊 fox icon!
    
    Can't find icon?
    - Try refreshing browser
    - Check extensions menu
    ..."""

elif "step 3" in question or "recovery" in question:
    response = """⚠️ CRITICAL: Saving Recovery Phrase!
    
    This is MOST IMPORTANT step!
    
    Do this:
    1. Click 'Reveal Secret Recovery Phrase'
    2. Write ALL 12 words on paper
    3. Store paper safely
    
    NEVER EVER:
    ❌ Take screenshot
    ❌ Save in email
    ❌ Share with anyone
    ..."""

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Screenshot Privacy
- ✅ Screenshots processed in-memory
- ✅ Not stored on servers
- ✅ Deleted immediately after analysis
- ✅ Sent via HTTPS only

### Recovery Phrase Detection
```python
# If Gemini sees recovery phrase in screenshot
if "recovery" in detected_content or len(words) == 12:
    response = """⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING! ⚠️⚠️⚠️
    
    I can see your recovery phrase in this screenshot!
    
    IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
    1. DELETE this screenshot NOW
    2. Make sure you wrote the 12 words on PAPER
    3. NEVER take screenshots of this screen again
    4. NEVER share this screenshot with anyone
    
    Those 12 words = full access to your wallet.
    Keep them secret and safe!"""
```

### User Education
- Multiple warnings before Step 3
- Red alert boxes for recovery phrase
- Video tutorials on security
- Clear "DO NOT" lists
- Emphasis on paper-only storage
