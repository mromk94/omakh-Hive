# ADVISORS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

**Last Updated**: October 9, 2025, 8:15 AM  
**Contract**: `AdvisorsManager.sol`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented & Compiled

---

## üéØ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Old System** ‚ùå:
- Fixed single advisor wallet at deployment
- No flexibility to add advisors later
- All 40M goes to one address

**New System** ‚úÖ:
- **Dynamic advisor addition** - Admin adds advisors anytime
- **Split 40M across 10-20 wallets** - Each advisor gets individual allocation
- **Flexible amounts** - Admin decides how much per advisor
- **Queen can propose, Admin approves** - Two-step process for security
- **Individual vesting per advisor** - Each gets 12m cliff + 18m linear

---

## üì¶ HOW IT WORKS

### **Step 1: Deployment**

```javascript
// Deploy AdvisorsManager
const advisorsManager = await AdvisorsManager.deploy(
    omkToken.address,
    adminWallet.address,
    queenWallet.address
);

// AdvisorsManager receives 40M OMK from VestingManager
// Now sitting in pool, ready to allocate
```

### **Step 2: Add Advisors (Two Ways)**

#### **Option A: Queen Proposes ‚Üí Admin Approves**

```solidity
// 1. Queen proposes advisor
queenAI.proposeAdvisor(
    "0xAdvisor1...",  // Advisor wallet
    2_000_000 OMK,    // 2M allocation
    "Marketing Advisor"
);

// 2. Admin reviews and approves
admin.approveProposal(proposalId);
// ‚úÖ Advisor added, vesting starts!
```

#### **Option B: Admin Adds Directly**

```solidity
// Admin can bypass proposal system
admin.addAdvisorDirect(
    "0xAdvisor2...",
    1_500_000 OMK,
    "Tech Advisor"
);
// ‚úÖ Immediate addition
```

### **Step 3: Advisors Claim**

```solidity
// After 12 month cliff, advisors can claim monthly
advisor.claimMyTokens();
// Tokens released according to vesting schedule
```

```javascript
admin.addAdvisorDirect(
    "0xMarketing...",
    2_000_000 OMK,
    "CMO - Marketing Strategy"
);
```
```
Allocated: 2M
Available: 38M
Advisors: 1
```

**Month 3 - Add Tech Advisor**:
```javascript
queenAI.proposeAdvisor(
    "0xTechLead...",
    3_000_000 OMK,
    "CTO - Technical Architecture"
);
admin.approveProposal(1);
```
```
Allocated: 5M
Available: 35M
Advisors: 2
```

**Month 6 - Add Legal + BD**:
```javascript
admin.addAdvisorDirect("0xLegal...", 1_500_000, "Legal Counsel");
admin.addAdvisorDirect("0xBizDev...", 2_500_000, "BD Lead");
```
```
Allocated: 9M
Available: 31M
Advisors: 4
```

### **Year 2**

**Month 13 - First Claims Start!**
```javascript
// Marketing Advisor (added month 1) reaches 12m cliff
marketingAdvisor.claimMyTokens();
// Receives: 2M √∑ 18 = ~111,111 OMK (first month)
```

**Month 15 - Tech Advisor Claims**
```javascript
// Tech Advisor (added month 3) reaches 12m cliff
techAdvisor.claimMyTokens();
// Receives: 3M √∑ 18 = 166,666 OMK (first month)
```

**Ongoing - Add More Advisors**:
```javascript
