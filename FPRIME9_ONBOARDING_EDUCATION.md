### **4. Security Education Module**

#### **A. Seed Phrase Security**

**Teacher Bee Security Lesson:**
```
👑🐝: "Let's talk about keeping your crypto SAFE! 🔐"

🎓 Lesson: Your Seed Phrase is Your Bank

Think of your seed phrase like:
• The master key to your vault
• Can't be changed
• Anyone with it can steal EVERYTHING
• Lost forever if you lose it

📖 Real-World Example:

Imagine your wallet is a safe deposit box.
Your seed phrase is the ONLY key.

❌ If you lose it:
• Bank can't make you a new one
• Your money is locked forever
• No customer support can help

❌ If someone steals it:
• They can open your safe
• Take everything
• You can't stop them
• You can't get it back

💡 Best Practices:

1. Write it on paper (not digital)
2. Make 2-3 copies
3. Store in different locations:
   • Home safe
   • Bank safety deposit box
   • Trusted family member's safe

[✅ I understand]
[❓ Ask a question]
[📹 Show me examples]
```

#### **B. Scam Prevention**

**Common Scams Module:**
```
👑🐝: "Let's learn about common scams to avoid! ⚠️"

🚨 Never Trust Messages Saying:

❌ "Send crypto to verify your account"
❌ "Urgent: Your wallet is compromised"
❌ "We need your seed phrase to help"
❌ "Free crypto giveaway - send first"
❌ "Technical support needs remote access"

✅ Remember:
• Omakh will NEVER ask for your seed phrase
• No legitimate company will
• Never click links in DMs
• Always type URLs manually
