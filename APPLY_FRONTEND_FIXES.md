# 🔄 APPLY FRONTEND FIXES - STEP BY STEP

**Issue:** Frontend has the fixes in source code, but browser hasn't picked them up yet.

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION - FIXES ARE IN SOURCE CODE**

**Checked Files:**

1. ✅ `/omk-frontend/app/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
   - Line 81-84: Toast only shown once with ID ✅
   - Line 146: `toast.dismiss('ws-failed')` added ✅
   - Line 151-152: `reconnectInterval: 5000`, `maxReconnectAttempts: 3` ✅

2. ✅ `/omk-frontend/app/kingdom/components/HiveIntelligence.tsx`
   - Line 40-49: Delayed HTTP fallback (3 second timer) ✅

**All fixes are in the code!** But the browser needs to reload them.

---

## 🔧 **HOW TO APPLY THE FIXES**

### **Option 1: Hard Refresh Browser (RECOMMENDED)**

**In your browser on the Hive Intelligence page:**

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (clear cache)
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`

**Firefox:**
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + F5`

**Safari:**
- `Cmd + Option + E` (empty cache) then `Cmd + R` (reload)

**Or:**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Click "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

---

### **Option 2: Restart Next.js Dev Server**

**If hard refresh doesn't work:**

```bash
# In the terminal running the frontend:
# 1. Stop the server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Restart it:
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/omakh-Hive/omk-frontend
npm run dev

# Wait for "✓ Ready in X seconds"
# Then refresh browser
```

---

### **Option 3: Clear Browser Cache Completely**

**Chrome:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Clear storage" in left sidebar
4. Click "Clear site data"
5. Refresh page

**Firefox:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Storage" tab
3. Right-click on localhost
4. "Delete All"
5. Refresh page

---

## 🧪 **HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKED**

### **Step 1: Open Browser DevTools Console**
Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)

### **Step 2: Go to Hive Intelligence Page**
Navigate to Kingdom → Hive Dashboard

### **Step 3: Check Console Output**

**If Backend Running:**
```
✅ Should see:
🐝 Connected to Hive Intelligence stream
✅ Hive Intelligence data loaded via WebSocket

❌ Should NOT see:
Lost connection to server (multiple times)
```

**If Backend NOT Running:**
```
✅ Should see:
🔄 Reconnecting... (Attempt 1/3)
🔄 Reconnecting... (Attempt 2/3)
🔄 Reconnecting... (Attempt 3/3)
❌ Max reconnect attempts reached
WebSocket not connected, using HTTP fallback

✅ ONE toast notification (not multiple)
✅ Data loads via HTTP after 3 seconds
```

---

## 🐛 **IF STILL SHOWING SPAM NOTIFICATIONS**

### **Check 1: Files Really Updated?**

```bash
# Verify the fixes are in the files:
grep -A 2 "Only show error toast once" /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/omakh-Hive/omk-frontend/app/hooks/useWebSocket.ts

# Should output:
# // Only show error toast once after max attempts reached
# if (reconnectAttemptsRef.current === maxReconnectAttempts) {
```

### **Check 2: Browser Cache Issue?**

Try **Incognito/Private Window:**
- Chrome: `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows)
- Navigate to localhost:3000
- Go to Hive Intelligence
- Should work correctly

### **Check 3: Dev Server Picked Up Changes?**

**In the terminal running frontend, look for:**
```
✓ Compiled /.../useWebSocket.ts in X ms
✓ Compiled /.../HiveIntelligence.tsx in X ms
```

If you DON'T see these, the dev server didn't detect changes.

**Force reload:**
```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Delete .next cache:
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/omakh-Hive/omk-frontend
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX**

### **Scenario 1: Backend Running**
```
1. Open Hive Intelligence ✅
2. WebSocket connects immediately ✅
3. See "🐝 Connected" in console ✅
4. Data loads via WebSocket ✅
5. No error notifications ✅
6. Live updates every 5 seconds ✅
```

### **Scenario 2: Backend NOT Running**
```
1. Open Hive Intelligence ✅
2. WebSocket tries to connect (3 attempts) ✅
3. See "🔄 Reconnecting..." in console ✅
4. After 3 failed attempts:
   - ONE notification: "WebSocket connection failed. Using HTTP fallback." ✅
5. After 3 seconds, data loads via HTTP ✅
6. Page works normally (without live updates) ✅
7. No notification spam! ✅
```

## 📝 **TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Hard refresh browser (`Cmd+Shift+R`)
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Check DevTools Console for verification
- [ ] Try incognito/private window
- [ ] Restart Next.js dev server if needed
- [ ] Delete `.next` cache and rebuild
- [ ] Verify files contain the fixes (grep command above)

---

## ✅ **SUMMARY**

**The fixes ARE in the source code.**

**To apply them:**
1. **Hard refresh your browser** (`Cmd+Shift+R` or `Ctrl+Shift+R`)
2. If that doesn't work, restart the Next.js dev server
3. If still issues, clear browser cache completely

**After refresh, you should see:**
- ✅ Only ONE error notification (if WebSocket fails)
- ✅ Automatic HTTP fallback
- ✅ No notification spam
- ✅ Page works normally

**The code is fixed, just needs to be reloaded in the browser! 🚀**
