# ✅ SERVER START FIX - ImportError Resolved

**Issue:** Backend failed to start with ImportError

---

## 🐛 **THE BUG**

```python
# main.py line 91 - BAD
from app.api.v1 import auth, queen, queen_dev, health, admin, ...
                                                ^^^^^^
# ImportError: cannot import name 'health' from 'app.api.v1'
```

**Problem:** `health` doesn't exist at `app.api.v1`, it's at `app.api.v1.endpoints.health`

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

Removed `health` from the import (it's not needed - already in router.py):

```python
# main.py line 91 - FIXED
from app.api.v1 import auth, queen, queen_dev, admin, frontend, market, notifications, claude_analysis
# No more 'health' import ✅
```

---

## 🚀 **NOW START THE SERVER**

```bash
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/omakh-Hive/backend/queen-ai
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

**Should see:**
```
✅ Database schema initialized
✅ Queen AI ready and operational
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001
```

---

## 📋 **OR USE THE STARTUP SCRIPT**

```bash
cd /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/omakh-Hive
./start-omakh.sh
```

Should now work! ✅

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS HAPPENING**

When I added the new router imports, I accidentally left `health` in the import list. The `health` module is at `app.api.v1.endpoints.health` and is already registered via `router.py`, so it doesn't need to be imported directly in `main.py`.

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION**

After starting, test:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Should return:
{
  "service": "Queen AI Orchestrator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

---

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED - Server should start now!**
