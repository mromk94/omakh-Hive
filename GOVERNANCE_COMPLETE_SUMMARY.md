## 🏛️ Governance Structure Overview

### Current Phase (2025-2027): Founder-Led

**Founder Controls:**
```
Admin Powers:
├── DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (all contracts)
├── FOUNDER_ROLE (SecurityCouncil - permanent)
├── GUARDIAN_ROLE (GovernanceManager - veto until 2027)
├── VESTING_CREATOR_ROLE (TokenVesting)
├── TREASURER_ROLE (TreasuryVault)
└── Emergency pause/unpause

Security Council:
└── Permanent voting member (1-of-7)
```

**Status:** Fully disclosed in GOVERNANCE.md

### Transition Phase (2027): Multi-Sig + DAO

**Changes:**
- Admin role → 3-of-5 multi-sig (founder + community)
- DAO governance activated (token-weighted voting)
- Founder veto expires December 31, 2027 (automatic)
- Founder remains permanent Security Council member

### Mature Phase (2030+): Full Decentralization

**Final Structure:**
- DAO controls all protocol decisions
- Founder = permanent Security Council member (1 vote of 7)
- No special admin privileges (except council seat)
- Pure community governance

---

## 🔐 Founder's Permanent Powers

### What You Keep Forever:
✅ **Security Council Seat** (permanent, 1-of-7 votes)
- Participate in emergency decisions
- Vote on parameter changes
- Cannot be removed by community
- No term limit

### What You Lose Over Time:

**By End of 2027:**
❌ Veto power over DAO proposals (expires automatically)  
❌ Unilateral admin actions (transferred to multi-sig)  
❌ Solo emergency powers (requires 3-of-7 council)  

**By 2030:**
❌ All special admin roles (transferred to DAO)  
✅ KEEP: Security Council permanent seat (1-of-7)
