# 🌟 Context-Aware Queen AI - Complete Implementation

**Date:** October 10, 2025, 11:55 PM  
**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

Queen AI is now **fully context-aware** and intelligently routes users to the right features based on their messages and conversation history.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 1. **Context Analyzer** (`backend/queen-ai/app/services/context_analyzer.py`)

The brain of the system that analyzes:
- ✅ User intent from messages
- ✅ Full conversation history
- ✅ User behavior patterns
- ✅ Wallet connection status
- ✅ System diagnostics

**Capabilities:**
```python
analyzer = ContextAnalyzer()

analysis = analyzer.analyze_message(
    user_message="I want to buy OMK",
    chat_history=[...all previous messages...]
)

# Returns:
{
    'intent': 'buy_omk',
    'confidence': 0.95,
    'recommended_actions': [
        {
            'type': 'card',
            'card_type': 'omk_purchase',
            'label': '🪙 Buy OMK Tokens',
            'priority': 1
        }
    ],
    'bee_to_consult': 'omk_purchase',
    'context_summary': {...},
    'needs_clarification': False
}
```

---

### 2. **Intent Detection**

Queen AI recognizes these intents:

| Intent | Patterns | Example Messages |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **portfolio_view** | "show portfolio", "my balance", "what do I own" | "Show me my assets" |
| **buy_omk** | "buy OMK", "purchase tokens", "get OMK" | "I want to buy OMK" |
| **invest_property** | "invest in property", "real estate", "browse properties" | "Show me properties" |
| **swap_tokens** | "swap", "exchange", "ETH to OMK" | "Swap ETH for OMK" |
| **market_data** | "ETH price", "crypto prices", "market data" | "What's the price of ETH?" |
| **news** | "crypto news", "latest updates", "market news" | "Any crypto news?" |
| **help** | "help", "how to", "guide", "tutorial" | "How do I invest?" |
| **profile** | "my profile", "settings", "account" | "View my profile" |
| **system_diagnostic** | "check system", "what's working", "debug" | "Diagnose the system" |

---

### 3. **Intelligent Routing**

Queen AI automatically routes to the correct bee:

```
User Message → Context Analyzer → Intent Detection → Bee Assignment → Response
```

**Bee Routing Map:**
- `portfolio_view` → `user_experience` bee
- `buy_omk` → `omk_purchase` bee
- `invest_property` → `property_tokenization` bee
- `market_data` → `market_data` bee (🐝 MarketBee)
- `news` → `news_aggregator` bee (🐝 NewsBee)
- `help` → `teacher` bee (🐝 TeacherBee)
- `system_diagnostic` → `system_monitor` bee

---

### 4. **Recommended Actions**

Queen AI provides contextual action buttons:

**Example 1: User asks "show my portfolio"**
```json
{
  "message": "Here's your portfolio overview!",
  "recommended_actions": [
    {
      "type": "card",
      "card_type": "dashboard",
      "label": "📊 View Your Portfolio",
      "description": "See your current holdings",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "action",
      "action": "buy_omk",
      "label": "🪙 Buy More OMK",
      "priority": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example 2: User asks "I want to invest"**
```json
{
  "message": "Great! Here are available properties",
  "recommended_actions": [
    {
      "type": "card",
      "card_type": "property_list",
      "label": "🏢 Browse Properties",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "info",
      "label": "📈 ROI Calculator",
      "priority": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 5. **System Diagnostics** 🔍

Queen AI can **diagnose herself**!

**User Message:** "Check the system" or "What's working?"

**Queen's Response:**
```json
{
  "frontend_routes": {
    "status": "operational",
    "working_routes": [
      {"/chat": "working"},
      {"/dashboard": "redirect_to_chat"},
      {"/invest": "redirect_to_chat"}
    ],
    "incomplete_components": [
      "OMKPurchaseCard - needs real contract",
      "PropertyListCard - needs backend API"
    ]
  },
  "backend_routes": {
    "working_endpoints": ["/health", "/chat", "/register"],
    "needs_implementation": ["/properties/list", "/omk/buy"]
  },
  "bees_status": {
    "total_bees": 19,
    "active_bees": ["user_experience", "teacher", "market_data"],
    "needs_activation": ["smart_contract_interaction"]
  },
  "blockchain_status": {
    "ethereum_node": "not connected",
    "contracts_deployed": false
  }
}
```

**Queen knows:**
- ✅ Which routes are working
- ✅ Which components are complete/incomplete
- ✅ Which bees are active
- ✅ Blockchain connection status
- ✅ What needs implementation

## 🔄 Complete Flow

### Example Conversation:

**User:** "I want to invest in real estate"

```
1. Frontend sends to backend:
   {
     user_input: "I want to invest in real estate",
     chat_history: [...all previous messages...],
     wallet_address: "0x9Ed590d2aD5a616fD0440E228186eD3d8034b00B"
   }

2. Backend Context Analyzer:
   - Detects intent: 'invest_property'
   - Confidence: 0.92
   - Assigns bee: 'property_tokenization'
   - Generates recommendations

3. Backend Response:
   {
     success: true,
     message: "Excellent choice! Here are available properties",
     recommended_actions: [
       {
         type: 'card',
         card_type: 'property_list',
         label: '🏢 Browse Properties',
         priority: 1
       }
     ],
     analysis: {...}
   }

4. Frontend displays:
   - AI message
   - PropertyCard inline in chat
   - Recommended action buttons
   - User stays in conversation!
```

## 📊 Context Analysis

Queen analyzes conversation history to understand:

### New vs. Returning Users
```python
context = {
    'is_new_user': len(user_messages) <= 2,
    'conversation_depth': len(history),
    'has_connected_wallet': True/False,
    'has_viewed_portfolio': True/False,
    'last_topic': 'portfolio_view'
}
```

## 🎓 For Developers

### Adding New Intents:

1. Add pattern to `context_analyzer.py`:
```python
self.intent_patterns = {
    'new_intent': [
        r'\bpattern1\b',
        r'\bpattern2\b'
    ]
}
```

2. Add recommendations:
```python
elif intent == 'new_intent':
    recommendations = [
        {
            'type': 'card',
            'card_type': 'new_card',
            'label': '✨ New Feature',
            'priority': 1
        }
    ]
```

3. Map to bee:
